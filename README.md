    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Digital Circuit Lab in Metaverse is an interactive virtual reality (VR) simulation of a digital circuit laboratory. It is built using Blender, the Metaverse Development Kit (MDK), and Python scripting to create 3D objects and the environment. The project provides an immersive experience where users can design, test, and simulate digital circuits in a collaborative virtual space.

  <section id="installation">
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>Blender (Version 3.6)</li>
       <li>Metaverse Development Kit (MDK) </li>
       <li>VR Headset (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Open Blender and load the project file <code>ohm's_law_verification.blend</code>.</li>
       <li>Set up your VR headset and ensure it is properly connected to your computer.</li>
       <li>Enable the VR mode in Blender to enter the virtual circuit lab.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id="usage">
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      In the VR mode of Blender, you can use your VR headset to navigate the virtual circuit lab. As till now we have design the setup for Ohm's Law Verification so interact with digital circuit components, place them on the order, and connect them to design your circuits.
    </p>

  <section id="collaboration-tools">
    <h2>Collaboration Tools</h2>
    <p>
      The digital circuit lab supports real-time collaboration with other users. Multiple users can join the virtual space using their VR headsets and interact with the circuit components together. Collaborative features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shared Environment: Users see each other's avatars and actions in the same virtual space.</li>
      <li>Voice Chat: Communicate with other users through built-in voice chat.</li>
      <li>Collaborative Design: Work together to build and test digital circuits.</li>
    </ul>
